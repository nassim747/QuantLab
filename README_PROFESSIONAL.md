### Key Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Dependency Injection**: Configuration and services injected, not hardcoded
3. **Error-First Design**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
4. **Scalability**: Modular design allows easy extension and modification
5. **Testability**: All components designed for easy unit and integration testing

## 📋 Technical Implementation Details

### Financial Modeling Approach

**Problem with Naive Approaches**: Many amateur quant projects predict absolute stock prices, which violates stationarity assumptions and leads to poor generalization.

**Professional Solution**: This project predicts **returns** (both simple and log returns), which are stationary and have better statistical properties for ML models.

```python
# Naive approach (WRONG)
target = data['Close'].shift(-5)  # Predicting future price

# Professional approach (CORRECT)
target = np.log(data['Close'].shift(-5) / data['Close'])  # Predicting log returns
```

### Risk Management Implementation

The backtesting engine implements realistic risk management:

```python
# Position sizing with volatility adjustment
def calculate_position_size(self, price, volatility):
    risk_adjusted_capital = self.available_capital / (volatility * 100)
    return min(risk_adjusted_capital / price, self.max_position_size)

# Stop-loss with slippage modeling
execution_price = price * (1 + self.slippage) if side == 'buy' else price * (1 - self.slippage)
```

### Portfolio Optimization Mathematics

Implements the full Markowitz framework:

- **Expected Return**: μ = w^T * R
- **Portfolio Variance**: σ² = w^T * Σ * w
- **Sharpe Ratio**: (μ - rf) / σ
- **Efficient Frontier**: Minimize σ² subject to target μ

```python
# Optimization objective
def objective(weights):
    portfolio_return = np.sum(mean_returns * weights)
    portfolio_vol = np.sqrt(np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(cov_matrix, weights)))
    return -(portfolio_return - risk_free_rate) / portfolio_vol  # Negative Sharpe
```
