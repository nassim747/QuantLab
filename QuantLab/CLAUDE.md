# Improvement Plan for Quant Lab Project

This file outlines a structured plan to improve your Quant Lab project using Claude (Anthropic's AI coding assistant). The goal is to address the weaknesses identified in the previous feedback, transforming the project from a basic demo into a more robust, professional portfolio piece. We'll focus on modularity, better ML practices, enhanced backtesting, code quality, and additional features.

The improvements will be implemented iteratively via prompts to Claude. Start with the **First Prompt** below, then build on the results with follow-up prompts (suggested in the *Iterative Prompt Guide* section).

## Key Principles for Improvements

- **Modularity**: Break the monolithic `app.py` into separate files (e.g., `data_utils.py`, `ml_models.py`, `backtester.py`, and keep `app.py` for UI).
- **ML Enhancements**: Add more features, use time-series aware models, implement proper validation, and predict returns instead of prices.
- **Backtesting**: Integrate a proper library like **Backtrader** for realistic simulations, add benchmarks, and more metrics.
- **Code Quality**: Add tests, error handling, logging, and documentation. Remove redundancies.
- **User Experience**: Improve UI flow, add multi-ticker support, and real-time elements.
- **Testing and Deployment**: Include unit tests and ensure the app is deployable.
- **Version Control**: Commit changes incrementally with meaningful messages.

## Step-by-Step Improvement Plan

### 1. Refactor Code Structure

- Create a modular setup with separate modules for data loading, ML training, backtesting, and UI.
- Use Streamlit's session state more efficiently or switch to multipage apps.

### 2. Enhance Data Handling

- Add feature engineering (e.g., lagged returns, moving averages, technical indicators like RSI, MACD).
- Handle multiple tickers and external data sources (e.g., via Alpha Vantage API for more features).

### 3. Upgrade ML Pipeline

- Switch to predicting **returns** (e.g., next-day return) instead of absolute prices.
- Add time-series models: integrate **Prophet** or **LSTM** (using TensorFlow/Keras).
- Implement time-series cross-validation (e.g., `TimeSeriesSplit` from scikit-learn).
- Add hyper-parameter tuning with `GridSearchCV` or **Optuna**.
- Evaluate with financial metrics (e.g., hit rate for buy/sell signals).

### 4. Improve Backtesting and Strategy

- Integrate **Backtrader** or **Zipline** for professional backtesting (handles orders, positions, commissions, slippage).
- Add strategy options (e.g., mean-reversion, momentum) and parameters.
- Include benchmarks (e.g., buy-and-hold, market index).
- Compute advanced metrics: Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio, Monte Carlo simulations for risk.

### 5. Add Tests and Documentation

- Write unit tests using **pytest** (e.g., test data loading, model predictions, backtest calculations).
- Update `README.md` with new features, an architecture diagram, and a "Lessons Learned" section.
- Add inline comments and docstrings throughout the codebase.

### 6. Polish UI and Features

- Add progress bars for long operations.
- Implement saving/loading of trained models.
- Add visualizations like feature importance or prediction confidence.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness.

### 7. Dependencies and Optimization

- Update `requirements.txt`: add **backtrader**, **tensorflow** (for LSTM), **pytest**, etc. Remove unused packages (e.g., `matplotlib` if not needed).
- Optimize for performance (e.g., cache more functions, handle large datasets efficiently).

### 8. Potential Advanced Additions

- Real-time data streaming.
- Portfolio optimization (e.g., Markowitz).
- Deployment to a server with scheduling (e.g., daily model retraining).
